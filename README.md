# MS0003 Mini Project - World Energy Usage

__Problem Statement__

The United Nations is looking to promote the usage of renewable energy sources in order to meet the target of net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050, where countries would rely entirely on renewable energy sources. At this current rate, no country is set to meet the target. 
The data science department has been tasked to identify the continent that has made the most progress in transitioning to renewable energy. With their current rate of progress, they are to predict whether that continent is from the target of being fully reliant (100%) on renewables energy.
