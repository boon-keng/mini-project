# MS0003 Mini Project - World Energy Usage

The United Nations is looking to reduce carbon footprint of countries and minimize their reliance on non-renewable energy sources. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a surge in usage of non-renewable energy in various countries following the relaxation of quarantine procedures.

The data science department has been tasked to identify countries that have been using non-renewable energy beyond a certain benchmark to fuel their development and determine how to regulate non-renewable energy usage through tariffs and grants to support renewable energy usage.

They have collected data on population, GDP, and various types of energy consumption from renewables to non-renewables for different countries. 

Using this data, they want to develop a model that can classify countries into developed and developing countries and then cluster them based on their renewable and non-renewable energy usage patterns. This will allow them to identify which countries are in line with their goals and enact the relevant tariffs/grants accordingly.

__Stance of the United Nations__

United Nations (UN) has been actively working towards reducing non-renewable energy and fossil fuel usage, as part of its efforts to mitigate climate change and promote sustainable development. The UN has set various targets and initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy sources and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.

For example, the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development includes a goal to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all (Goal 7). This goal includes targets to increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix and improve energy efficiency.

Additionally, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an international treaty aimed at mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and addressing climate change. The UNFCCC includes various mechanisms, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from various sectors, including energy production.

Regarding nuclear energy, the UN's stance is more nuanced. While the organization recognizes the potential benefits of nuclear energy in terms of energy security, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and improving access to energy, it also acknowledges the potential risks associated with nuclear technology, such as accidents and the disposal of nuclear waste.

Therefore, the UN's approach to nuclear energy is to promote its safe and secure use while ensuring that it does not detract from the development of renewable energy sources. The UN also recognizes the need for greater transparency and international cooperation in nuclear energy-related issues.
